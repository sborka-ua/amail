This app is a Single Page Application featured with AngularJS $routeProvider, $cacheFactory, $http service and live search

It's a mail interface prototype that views lists of contacts and incoming emails

At first the $http service makes two REST requests to retrieve data for this lists from the .json files.
And then data is storing (and updating if needs) in the cache object for all the app life-cycle

Live search allows to filter the lists by typing in input field at the top of the page

In near future coming up the authorization fearure
